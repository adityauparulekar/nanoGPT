  Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at
high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that
catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that
complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysis
based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns
result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered
system.

  The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly
used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic
behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive
feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a
general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number
of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show
analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n
is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1
steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single
levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for
parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,
there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the
standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one
steady state.
  By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariance
characteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent for
the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at
$\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left
and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are
asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths,
respectively.
  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather
unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots
are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein
function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.
  We present some numerical results obtained from a simple individual based
model that describes clustering of organisms caused by competition. Our aim is
to show how, even when a deterministic description developed for continuum
models predicts no pattern formation, an individual based model displays well
defined patterns, as a consequence of fluctuations effects caused by the
discrete nature of the interacting agents.
  This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information,
especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional
studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and
cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the
physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,
are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently
as information becoming more complex.
  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple
scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,
psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used
to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.
  Alexander B. Medvinsky \emph{et al} [A. B. Medvinsky, I. A. Tikhonova, R. R.
Aliev, B.-L. Li, Z.-S. Lin, and H. Malchow, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{64}, 021915
(2001)] and Marcus R. Garvie \emph{et al} [M. R. Garvie and C. Trenchea, SIAM
J. Control. Optim. \textbf{46}, 775-791 (2007)] shown that the minimal
spatially extended reaction-diffusion model of phytoplankton-zooplankton can
exhibit both regular, chaotic behavior, and spatiotemporal patterns in a patchy
environment. Based on that, the spatial plankton model is furtherly
investigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in the
present paper when its parameters would be expected in the case of mixed
Turing-Hopf bifurcation region. Our results show that the spiral waves exist in
that region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-field
breakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients of
phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from
the far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole
space within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computation
spectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains. Finally, we give some
explanations about the spatially structured patterns from the community level.
  This letter reports complete sets of two-fold symmetries between partitions
of the universal genetic code. By substituting bases at each position of the
codons according to a fixed rule, it happens that properties of the degeneracy
pattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity are exchanged.
  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general
networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the "rock-paper-scissor" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.
  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain
will help to understand its function and may provide insights into many
properties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to
their dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex
networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and
functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks
recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random
(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that
have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,
hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network
analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and
macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark
rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis
strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and
connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free
networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck
connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'
connectivity.
  Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to
understand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature.
The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and
his colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer
accumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering
all available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer
theory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer
theories. They have then listed 9 "absolute discrepancies" for such cancer
theory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major
reasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a
first principle computation, is explicitly pointed out.
  Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a
nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The
weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as
an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we
demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that
equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For
this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient
than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering
whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the
beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as
it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.
Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.
  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks
have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to
different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas
(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending
on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local
and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly
adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.
  The parsimony score of a character on a tree equals the number of state
changes required to fit that character onto the tree. We show that for
unordered, reversible characters this score equals the number of tree
rearrangements required to fit the tree onto the character. We discuss
implications of this connection for the debate over the use of consensus trees
or total evidence, and show how it provides a link between incongruence of
characters and recombination.
  A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method
is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins
and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model,
proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume
defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element
representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that
facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial
resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of
T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler
buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare
favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks
procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational
framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates
the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,
including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is
equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to
electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular
assemblies of unknown atomic structure.
  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a
behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.
  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal
transmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical
threshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of
stochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input
signals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small
amounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR
in the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between
Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for
optimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is
achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the
noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal
distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical
verification and justification for previous work in both computational
neuroscience and electronics.
  The holographic bound in physics constrains the complexity of life. The
finite storage capability of information in the observable universe requires
the protein linguistics in the evolution of life. We find that the evolution of
genetic code determines the variance of amino acid frequencies and genomic GC
content among species. The elegant linguistic mechanism is confirmed by the
experimental observations based on all known entire proteomes.
  A fast and accurate computational scheme for simulating nonlinear dynamic
systems is presented. The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by
a combination of components of only two different types: first-order low-pass
filters and static nonlinearities. The parameters of these filters and
nonlinearities may depend on system variables, and the topology of the system
may be complex, including feedback. Several examples taken from neuroscience
are given: phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation
according to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The scheme uses two slightly
different forms of autoregressive filters, with an implicit delay of zero for
feedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for
feedback control. On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal
cell it computes, for a given level of accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster
than 4th-order Runge-Kutta. The computational scheme has minimal memory
requirements, and is also suited for computation on a stream processor, such as
a GPU (Graphical Processing Unit).
  We present a simple and generic theoretical description of actin-based
motility, where polymerization of filaments maintains propulsion. The dynamics
is driven by polymerization kinetics at the filaments' free ends, crosslinking
of the actin network, attachment and detachment of filaments to the obstacle
interfaces and entropic forces. We show that spontaneous oscillations in the
velocity emerge in a broad range of parameter values, and compare our findings
with experiments.
  Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the
reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we
show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is
bendable, e.g. at a localized "hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest
with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the
transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of "cargo'' attached to
the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this
effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier
crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.
  We propose a combined experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical
study of the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to
biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA
complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts.
First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed
between conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative
changes in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then,
the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the
evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a
linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract
the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to
previous studies.
  The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling
and allocation problems, and more recently for specific bioinformatic problems.
Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and
justify the introduction of a hierarchy of subclasses of 2-interval graphs that
generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and
(x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions
are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval
graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints
on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying
relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs,
K_{1,5}-free graphs, ...
  Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its
growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or
transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels
of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to
investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.
Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,
and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the
analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the
exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer
system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the
abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic
network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in
different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,
fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate
elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely
shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study
metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks
which are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for
bioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.
  Many important real-world networks manifest "small-world" properties such as
scale-free degree distributions, small diameters, and clustering. The most
common model of growth for these networks is "preferential attachment", where
nodes acquire new links with probability proportional to the number of links
they already have. We show that preferential attachment is a special case of
the process of molecular evolution. We present a new single-parameter model of
network growth that unifies varieties of preferential attachment with the
quasispecies equation (which models molecular evolution), and also with the
Erdos-Renyi random graph model. We suggest some properties of evolutionary
models that might be applied to the study of networks. We also derive the form
of the degree distribution resulting from our algorithm, and we show through
simulations that the process also models aspects of network growth. The
unification allows mathematical machinery developed for evolutionary dynamics
to be applied in the study of network dynamics, and vice versa.
  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such
as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any
individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally
similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and
capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of
these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.
  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution
favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently
large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection
pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that
proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards
higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve
greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both
mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and
stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be
quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral
network.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general
tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in
highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute
to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that
exist in large populations.
  A practical introduction to stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion
processes is presented. No prior knowledge of stochastic simulations is
assumed. The methods are explained using illustrative examples. The article
starts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of
chemical reactions. Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular
diffusion are given. Finally, basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are
presented. The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic
models are explained and basic mathematical tools (e.g. chemical master
equation) are presented. The article concludes with an overview of more
advanced methods and problems.
  Data on the prevalence of bone cancer in dinosaurs is available from past
radiological examination of preserved bones. We statistically test this data
for consistency with rates extrapolated from information on bone cancer in
modern vertebrates, and find that there is no evidence of a different rate.
Thus, this test provides no support for a possible role of ionizing radiation
in the K-T extinction event.
  Objectives: In this study, we quantify the growth variability of tumour cell
clones from a human leukemia cell line. Materials and methods: We have used
microplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of
individual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal
population has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic
equation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different
clones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate
of the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their
offsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones
did not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting
that growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed
distributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model
assuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive
cell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,
we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number
of mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed
distributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were
rendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal
growth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell
population is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At
least part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of
mitochondria.
  Chargaff's second parity rule holds empirically for most types of DNA that
along single strands of DNA the base contents are equal for complimentary
bases, A = T, G = C. A Markov chain model is constructed to track the evolution
of any single base position along single strands of genomes whose organisms are
equipped with replication mismatch repair. Under the key assumptions that
mismatch error rates primarily depend the number of hydrogen bonds of
nucleotides and that the mismatch repairing process itself makes strand
recognition error, the model shows that the steady state probabilities for any
base position to take on one of the 4 nucleotide bases are equal for
complimentary bases. As a result, Chargaff's second parity rule is the
manifestation of the Law of Large Number acting on the steady state
probabilities. More importantly, because the model pinpoints mismatch repair as
a basis of the rule, it is suitable for experimental verification.
  A Boolean network model of the cell-cycle regulatory network of fission yeast
(Schizosaccharomyces Pombe) is constructed solely on the basis of the known
biochemical interaction topology. Simulating the model in the computer,
faithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along
the cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation
models, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory
circuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological
dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the
biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state
space, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive
trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of
the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in
circuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a
strongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network
represents an auto-excited system with external damping.
  Phylogenetic mixtures model the inhomogeneous molecular evolution commonly
observed in data. The performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods where
the underlying data is generated by a mixture model has stimulated considerable
recent debate. Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture model
data on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a tree
of a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomings
of particular tree reconstruction methods. In so doing, the underlying
assumption was that mixture model data on one topology can be distinguished
from data evolved on an unmixed tree of another topology given enough data and
the ``correct'' method. Here we show that this assumption can be false. For
biologists our results imply that, for example, the combined data from two
genes whose phylogenetic trees differ only in terms of branch lengths can
perfectly fit a tree of a different topology.
  Protein-DNA complexes with loops play a fundamental role in a wide variety of
cellular processes, ranging from the regulation of DNA transcription to
telomere maintenance. As ubiquitous as they are, their precise in vivo
properties and their integration into the cellular function still remain
largely unexplored. Here, we present a multilevel approach that efficiently
connects in both directions molecular properties with cell physiology and use
it to characterize the molecular properties of the looped DNA-lac repressor
complex while functioning in vivo. The properties we uncover include the
presence of two representative conformations of the complex, the stabilization
of one conformation by DNA architectural proteins, and precise values of the
underlying twisting elastic constants and bending free energies. Incorporation
of all this molecular information into gene-regulation models reveals an
unprecedented versatility of looped DNA-protein complexes at shaping the
properties of gene expression.
  Surviving in a diverse environment requires corresponding organism responses.
At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors
(TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of
non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors
locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of
speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the
protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this
paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering
a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of
low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,
corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.
We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes
by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks
along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and
then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and
a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then
re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final
probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can
locate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time
diffusing freely in the solution. This indeed agrees with recent experimental
results obtained by Elf et al. 2007 and is in contrast with theoretical
expectation.
  We report 10 successfully folding events of trpzip2 by molecular dynamics
simulation. It is found that the trizip2 can fold into its native state through
different zipper pathways, depending on the ways of forming hydrophobic core.
We also find a very fast non-zipper pathway. This indicates that there may be
no inconsistencies in the current pictures of beta-hairpin folding mechanisms.
These pathways occur with different probabilities. zip-out is the most probable
one. This may explain the recent experiment that the turn formation is the
rate-limiting step for beta-hairpin folding.
  Is it possible to link a set of nodes without using preexisting positional
information or any kind of long-range attraction of the nodes? Can the process
of generating positional information, i.e. the detection of ``unknown'' nodes
and the estabishment of chemical gradients, \emph{and} the process of network
formation, i.e. the establishment of links between nodes, occur in parallel, on
a comparable time scale, as a process of co-evolution?
  The paper discusses a model where the generation of relevant information for
establishing the links between nodes results from the interaction of many
\emph{agents}, i.e. subunits of the system that are capable of performing some
activities. Their collective interaction is based on (indirect) communication,
which also includes memory effects and the dissemination of information in the
system. The relevant (``pragmatic'') information that leads to the
establishment of the links then emerges from an evolutionary interplay of
selection and reamplification.
  The complementary strands of DNA molecules can be separated when stretched
apart by a force; the unzipping signal is correlated to the base content of the
sequence but is affected by thermal and instrumental noise. We consider here
the ideal case where opening events are known to a very good time resolution
(very large bandwidth), and study how the sequence can be reconstructed from
the unzipping data. Our approach relies on the use of statistical Bayesian
inference and of Viterbi decoding algorithm. Performances are studied
numerically on Monte Carlo generated data, and analytically. We show how
multiple unzippings of the same molecule may be exploited to improve the
quality of the prediction, and calculate analytically the number of required
unzippings as a function of the bandwidth, the sequence content, the elasticity
parameters of the unzipped strands.
  In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic
networks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n
much smaller than the number of genes p. The approach is based on the concept
of low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of
Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of
graphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this
way, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order
conditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the
large p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by
considering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth
order conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic
properties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant
dependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this
approximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The
inference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available
from the CRAN archive.
  The puzzle presented by the famous stumps of Gilboa, New York, finds a
solution in the discovery of two fossil specimens that allow the entire
structure of these early trees to be reconstructed.
  If predictions for species extinctions hold, then the `tree of life' today
may be quite different to that in (say) 100 years. We describe a technique to
quantify how much each species is likely to contribute to future biodiversity,
as measured by its expected contribution to phylogenetic diversity. Our
approach considers all possible scenarios for the set of species that will be
extant at some future time, and weights them according to their likelihood
under an independent (but not identical) distribution on species extinctions.
Although the number of extinction scenarios can typically be very large, we
show that there is a simple algorithm that will quickly compute this index. The
method is implemented and applied to the prosimian primates as a test case, and
the associated species ranking is compared to a related measure (the `Shapley
index'). We describe indices for rooted and unrooted trees, and a modification
that also includes the focal taxon's probability of extinction, making it
directly comparable to some new conservation metrics.
  For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules is
small, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. This
molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the
predictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few
analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems.
Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include
leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the
steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed,
facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic
effects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in a
manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we
consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a
negative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that
translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional
control. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a
positive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control is
harnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.
  Medvedev and Melott (2007) have suggested that periodicity in fossil
biodiversity may be induced by cosmic rays which vary as the Solar System
oscillates normal to the galactic disk. We re-examine the evidence for a 62
million year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic
history of animal life reported by Rohde & Mueller (2005), as well as related
questions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal
is robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based on
fluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic.
Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results
depending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM
may be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic
intervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,
the 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may
ultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in
extinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a
periodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately
27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.
  Secondary structure elements of many protein families exhibit differential
conservation on their opposing faces. Amphipathic helices and beta-sheets by
definition possess this property, and play crucial functional roles. This type
of evolutionary trajectory of a protein family is usually critical to the
functions of the protein family, as well as in creating functions within
subfamilies. That is, differential conservation maintains properties of a
protein structure related to its orientation, and that are important in
packing, recognition, and catalysis. Here I define and formulate a new concept,
called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein
sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.
  A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how working memory --
the ability to store information at intermediate timescales, like 10s of
seconds -- is implemented in realistic neuronal networks. The most likely
candidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort has
gone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quarter
century of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In
particular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that
attractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally
during working memory tasks? And second, how many memories can be stored under
biologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying an
attractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other.
Using mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor
networks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only
if the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field
analysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network
scales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been
suggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones. Both of these
predictions are verified using simulations with large networks of spiking
neurons.
  Successful predictions are among the most compelling validations of any
model. Extracting falsifiable predictions from nonlinear multiparameter models
is complicated by the fact that such models are commonly sloppy, possessing
sensitivities to different parameter combinations that range over many decades.
Here we discuss how sloppiness affects the sorts of data that best constrain
model predictions, makes linear uncertainty approximations dangerous, and
introduces computational difficulties in Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis. We
also present a useful test problem and suggest refinements to the standards by
which models are communicated.
  In most vertebrate species, the body axis is generated by the formation of
repeated transient structures called somites. This spatial periodicity in
somitogenesis has been related to the temporally sustained oscillations in
certain mRNAs and their associated gene products in the cells forming the
presomatic mesoderm. The mechanism underlying these oscillations have been
identified as due to the delays involved in the synthesis of mRNA and
translation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\bf 13}, 1398
(2003)]. In addition, in the zebrafish embryo intercellular Notch signalling
couples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in
the form of an Fgf8 gradient exists that could be used to transform these
coupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.
Here we consider a simple model based on this known biology and study its
consequences for somitogenesis. Comparison is made with the known properties of
somite formation in the zebrafish embryo . We also study the effects of
localized Fgf8 perturbations on somite patterning.
  We demonstrate the power of the genetic algorithms to construct the cellular
automata model simulating the growth of 2-dimensional close-to-circular
clusters revealing the desired properties, such as the growth rate and, at the
same time, the fractal behavior of their contours. The possible application of
the approach in the field of tumor modeling is outlined.
  An epidemic multi-strain model with temporary cross-immunity shows chaos,
even in a previously unexpected parameter region. Especially dengue fever
models with strong enhanced infectivity on secondary infection have previously
shown deterministic chaos motivated by experimental findings of
antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE). Including temporary cross-immunity in
such models, which is common knowledge among field researchers in dengue, we
find a deterministically chaotic attractor in the more realistic parameter
region of reduced infectivity on secondary infection (''inverse ADE'' parameter
region). This is realistic for dengue fever since on second infection people
are more likely to be hospitalized, hence do not contribute to the force of
infection as much as people with first infection.
  Our finding has wider implications beyond dengue in any multi-strain
epidemiological systems with altered infectivity upon secondary infection,
since we can relax the condition of rather high infectivity on secondary
infection previously required for deterministic chaos. For dengue the finding
of wide ranges of chaotic attractors open new ways to analysis of existing data
sets.
  RNA motifs typically consist of short, modular patterns that include base
pairs formed within and between modules. Estimating the abundance of these
patterns is of fundamental importance for assessing the statistical
significance of matches in genomewide searches, and for predicting whether a
given function has evolved many times in different species or arose from a
single common ancestor. In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and
self-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating
functions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in
biological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of
Markov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a
memoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of
automata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of
problems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings.
The applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of
automata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords
(including sets of patterns generated according to base pairing rules) in a
general text.
  The time-dependent transverse response of stiff polymers, represented as
weakly-bending wormlike chains (WLCs), is well-understood on the linear level,
where transverse degrees of freedom evolve independently from the longitudinal
ones. We show that, beyond a characteristic time scale, the nonlinear coupling
of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly
weakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response
predictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling
arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent
separation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover
scaling laws and exact analytical and numerical solutions for characteristic
response quantities are derived for different experimentally relevant setups.
Our findings are applicable to cytoskeletal filaments as well as DNA under
tension.
  Linear measures such as cross-correlation have been used successfully to
determine time delays from the given processes. Such an analysis often precedes
identifying possible causal relationships between the observed processes. The
present study investigates the impact of a positively correlated driver whose
correlation function decreases monotonically with lag on the delay estimation
in a two-node acyclic network with one and two-delays. It is shown that
cross-correlation analysis of the given processes can result in spurious
identification of multiple delays between the driver and the dependent
processes. Subsequently, delay estimation of increment process as opposed to
the original process under certain implicit constraints is explored.
Short-range and long-range correlated driver processes along with those of
their coarse-grained counterparts are considered.
  We have built an open-source software system for the modeling of biomolecular
reaction networks, SloppyCell, which is written in Python and makes substantial
use of third-party libraries for numerics, visualization, and parallel
programming. We highlight here some of the powerful features that Python
provides that enable SloppyCell to do dynamic code synthesis, symbolic
manipulation, and parallel exploration of complex parameter spaces.
  In the peripheral nervous system, utrophin and the short dystrophin isoform
(Dp116) are co-localized at the outermost layer of the myelin sheath of nerve
fibers; together with the dystroglycan complex. In peripheral nerve, matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) creates a 30 kDa fragment of beta-dystroglycan, leading
to a disruption of the link between the extracellular matrix and the cell
membrane. Here we asked if the processing of the beta-dystroglycan could
influence the anchorage of Dp116 or/and utrophin in normal and mdx Schwann cell
membrane. We showed that MMP-9 was more activated in mdx nerve than in
wild-type one. This activation leads to an accumulation of the 30 kDa
beta-dystroglycan isoform and have an impact on the anchorage of Dp116 and
utrophin isoforms in mdx Schwann cells membrane. Our results showed that Dp116
had greater affinity to the full length form of beta-dystroglycan than the 30
kDa form. Moreover, we showed for the first time that the short isoform of
utrophin (Up71) was over-expressed in mdx Schwann cells compared to wild-type.
In addition, this utrophin isoform (Up71) seems to have greater affinity to the
30 kDa beta-dystroglycan which could explain a more stabilization of this 30
kDa at the membrane compartment. Our results highlight the potential
participation of the short utrophin isoform and the cleaved form of
beta-dystroglycan in mdx Schwann cell membrane architecture.
  Transcription regulation typically involves the binding of proteins over long
distances on multiple DNA sites that are brought close to each other by the
formation of DNA loops. The inherent complexity of the assembly of regulatory
complexes on looped DNA challenges the understanding of even the simplest
genetic systems, including the prototypical lac operon. Here we implement a
scalable quantitative computational approach to analyze systems regulated
through multiple DNA sites with looping. Our approach applied to the lac operon
accurately predicts the transcription rate over five orders of magnitude for
wild type and seven mutants accounting for all the combinations of deletions of
the three operators. A quantitative analysis of the model reveals that the
presence of three operators provides a mechanism to combine robust repression
with sensitive induction, two seemingly mutually exclusive properties that are
required for optimal functioning of metabolic switches.
  The present paper aims at introducing the innovative technologies, based on
the concept of "sensory substitution" or "perceptual supplementation", we are
developing in the fields of human disability and biomedical engineering.
Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive
biomedical and/technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons
with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems.
Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case
of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); (2) ankle
proprioceptive acuity improvement for driving assistance in older and/or
disabled adults; and (3) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older
and/or disabled adults. This paper presents results of three feasibility
studies performed on young healthy adults.
  How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions
despite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We
show that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic
fluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even
without specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in
protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and
degradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an
adaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.
Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less
affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are
large, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells
are easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a
cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This
leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model
simulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results
suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a
process that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The
present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses
including the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.
  Pressure ulcers are recognized as a major health issue in individuals with
spinal cord injuries and new approaches to prevent this pathology are
necessary. An innovative health strategy is being developed through the use of
computer and sensory substitution via the tongue in order to compensate for the
sensory loss in the buttock area for individuals with paraplegia. This sensory
compensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a
localized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will
enable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the
cutaneous area of suffering. This work reports an initial evaluation of this
approach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in
pressure as a response to electro-stimulated information on the tongue.
Obtained during a clinical study in 10 healthy seated subjects, the first
results are encouraging, with 92% success in 100 performed tests. These
results, which have to be completed and validated in the paraplegic population,
may lead to a new approach to education in health to prevent the formation of
pressure ulcers within this population. Keywords: Spinal Cord Injuries,
Pressure Ulcer, Sensory Substitution, Health Education, Biomedical Informatics.
  Boolean Networks and their dynamics are of great interest as abstract
modeling schemes in various disciplines, ranging from biology to computer
science. Whereas parallel update schemes have been studied extensively in past
years, the level of understanding of asynchronous updates schemes is still very
poor. In this paper we study the propagation of external information given by
regulatory input variables into a random Boolean network. We compute both
analytically and numerically the time evolution and the asymptotic behavior of
this propagation of external regulation (PER). In particular, this allows us to
identify variables which are completely determined by this external
information. All those variables in the network which are not directly fixed by
PER form a core which contains in particular all non-trivial feedback loops. We
design a message-passing approach allowing to characterize the statistical
properties of these cores in dependence of the Boolean network and the external
condition. At the end we establish a link between PER dynamics and the full
random asynchronous dynamics of a Boolean network.
  One of the major problems in computational biology is the inability of
existing classification models to incorporate expanding and new domain
knowledge. This problem of static classification models is addressed in this
paper by the introduction of incremental learning for problems in
bioinformatics. Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem
using static machine learning structures such as neural networks or support
vector machines that are unable to accommodate new information into their
existing models. We utilize the fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternate machine learning
system that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes
available. The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread
machine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection
and combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with
the incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable
as a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the
G-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83%. The system
presented is also generally applicable, and can be used in problems in genomics
and proteomics.
  The organization of the connectivity between mammalian cortical areas has
become a major subject of study, because of its important role in scaffolding
the macroscopic aspects of animal behavior and intelligence. In this study we
present a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network
organization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area
in the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global
cortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,
pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt
to recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical
connectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions
of the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological
features allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous
reconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in
substantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections
are relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial
properties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship
between area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental
rules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between
the predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the
poorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the
organization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial
constraints.
  Position determination in biological systems is often achieved through
protein concentration gradients. Measuring the local concentration of such a
protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of
position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,
position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental
limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients
due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on
gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have
been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology
settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great
precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.
As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely
directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional
precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging
time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for
high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the
existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is
maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the
concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints
on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various
contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single
cell.
  Simple nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple stable stationary states are
often taken as models for switchlike biological systems. This paper considers
the interaction of multiple such simple multistable systems when they are
embedded together into a larger dynamical "supersystem." Attention is focused
on the network structure of the resulting set of coupled differential
equations, and the consequences of this structure on the propensity of the
embedded switches to act independently versus cooperatively. Specifically, it
is argued that both larger average and larger variance of the node degree
distribution lead to increased switch independence. Given the frequency of
empirical observations of high variance degree distributions (e.g., power-law)
in biological networks, it is suggested that the results presented here may aid
in identifying switch-integrating subnetworks as comparatively homogenous,
low-degree, substructures. Potential applications to ecological problems such
as the relationship of stability and complexity are also briefly discussed.
  We present an exhaustive study of more than 250 ab initio potential energy
surfaces (PESs) of the model dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2. The model chemistries
(MCs) used are constructed as homo- and heterolevels involving possibly
different RHF and MP2 calculations for the geometry and the energy. The basis
sets used belong to a sample of 39 selected representants from Pople's
split-valence families, ranging from the small 3-21G to the large
6-311++G(2df,2pd). The reference PES to which the rest are compared is the
MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the more
accurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presented
is twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarization
and diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at
1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different
contraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation
of the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states
that heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel
approximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom
checked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,
have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first
time that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in full
PESs. In order to achieve these goals, all data sets have been compared and
analyzed in a way which captures the nearness concept in the space of MCs.
  Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) appears essential for the formation of
long-term memory, with memories at least partly encoded by patterns of
strengthened synapses. How memories are preserved for months or years, despite
molecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal
activity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to
preferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis
has not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing
biochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into
two such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential
biochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model
represents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed
model adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled
as continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of
synaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the
amplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or
theta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high
weight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter
variations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset
synapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,
episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.
Both models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are
expected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to
maintenance of synaptic strength.
  We study the growth of a directed transportation network, such as a food web,
in which links carry resources. We propose a growth process in which new nodes
(or species) preferentially attach to existing nodes with high indegree (in
food-web language, number of prey) and low outdegree (or number of predators).
This scheme, which we call inverse preferential attachment, is intended to
maximize the amount of resources available to each new node. We show that the
outdegree (predator) distribution decays at least exponentially fast for large
outdegree and is continuously tunable between an exponential distribution and a
delta function. The indegree (prey) distribution is poissonian in the
large-network limit.
  The properties of certain networks are determined by hidden variables that
are not explicitly measured. The conditional probability (propagator) that a
vertex with a given value of the hidden variable is connected to k of other
vertices determines all measurable properties. We study hidden variable models
and find an averaging approximation that enables us to obtain a general
analytical result for the propagator. Analytic results showing the validity of
the approximation are obtained. We apply hidden variable models to
protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) in which the hidden variable is the
association free-energy, determined by distributions that depend on
biochemistry and evolution. We compute degree distributions as well as
clustering coefficients of several PINs of different species; good agreement
with measured data is obtained. For the human interactome two different
parameter sets give the same degree distributions, but the computed clustering
coefficients differ by a factor of about two. This shows that degree
distributions are not sufficient to determine the properties of PINs.
  A general and basic model of primordial evolution--a soup of reacting
finitary and discrete processes--is employed to identify and analyze
fundamental mechanisms that generate and maintain complex structures in
prebiotic systems. The processes--$\epsilon$-machines as defined in
computational mechanics--and their interaction networks both provide well
defined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate
hierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found
that replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher
levels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local
components that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,
the finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that
favors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,
these results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global
complexity requires local simplicity.
  Background: Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular
networks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving
force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been
noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential
attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of
molecular networks.
  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by
including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of
unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to
quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in
itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites
in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree
distribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the
non-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.
  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial
recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic
regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad
to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a
main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene
duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree
distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream
regions of genes.
  Significant fraction (98.5% in humans) of most animal genomes is non- coding
dark matter. Its largely unknown function (1-5) is related to programming
(rather than to spontaneous mutations) of accurate adaptation to rapidly
changing environment. Programmed adaptation to the same universal law for
non-competing animals from anaerobic yeast to human is revealed in the study of
their extensively quantified mortality (6-21). Adaptation of animals with
removed non-coding DNA fractions may specify their contribution to genomic
programming. Emergence of new adaptation programs and their (non-Mendelian)
heredity may be studied in antibiotic mini-extinctions (22-24). On a large
evolutionary scale rapid universal adaptation was vital for survival, and
evolved, in otherwise lethal for diverse species major mass extinctions
(25-28). Evolutionary and experimental data corroborate these conclusions
(6-21, 29-32). Universal law implies certain biological universality of diverse
species, thus quantifies applicability of animal models to humans). Genomic
adaptation programming calls for unusual approach to its study and implies
unanticipated perspectives, in particular, directed biological changes.
  The probability distributions for bending angles in double helical DNA
obtained in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are compared with
theoretical predictions. The computed distributions remarkably agree with the
worm-like chain theory for double helices of one helical turn and longer, and
qualitatively differ from predictions of the semi-elastic chain model. The
computed data exhibit only small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of short
DNA and cannot account for the recently reported AFM data (Wiggins et al,
Nature nanotechnology 1, 137 (2006)). It is possible that the current atomistic
DNA models miss some essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate length
scales. Analysis of bent DNA structures reveals, however, that the bending
motion is structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic on the
intermediate length scales where the experimental anomalies were detected.
These effects are essential for interpretation of the experimental data and
they also can be responsible for the apparent discrepancy.
  Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a
crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay
revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of
epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms
of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology'
approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger.
I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum
mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead
Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of
stability of biological order.
  We investigate dynamical systems characterized by a time series of distinct
semi-stable activity patterns, as they are observed in cortical neural activity
patterns. We propose and discuss a general mechanism allowing for an adiabatic
continuation between attractor networks and a specific adjoined transient-state
network, which is strictly dissipative. Dynamical systems with transient states
retain functionality when their working point is autoregulated; avoiding
prolonged periods of stasis or drifting into a regime of rapid fluctuations. We
show, within a continuous-time neural network model, that a single local
updating rule for online learning allows simultaneously (i) for information
storage via unsupervised Hebbian-type learning, (ii) for adaptive regulation of
the working point and (iii) for the suppression of runaway synaptic growth.
Simulation results are presented; the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal
symmetry and link symmetry are discussed.
  BACKGROUND: Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins
are neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's
ability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein
functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, "promiscuous" functions
that are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are
neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause
substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable
future functional evolution.
  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how
cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on
a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on
five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much
as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous
activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely
rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The
activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated
fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change
in one function based on the measurement of several others.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead
to substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under
selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional
evolution should selection "ask new questions" in the future.
  The evolution of multicellular organisms from monocellular ancestors
represents one of the greatest advances of the history of life. The assembly of
such multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells:
over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely
sophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms may
not be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are
interested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still
achieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential
equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing
spiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to
represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is
followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to
emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of
single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball
atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug. The similarity with the behaviour of
modern Dictyostelium slime molds signalling with cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) is striking.
  In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene
is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor
(TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it
should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit.
Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic
range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the
regulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy
certain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement
with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila
embryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information
transmission.
  Previously, we have identified the cytoplasmic zinc metalloprotease
insulin-degrading enzyme(IDE) in human tissues by an immunohistochemical method
involving no antigen retrieval (AR) by pressure cooking to avoid artifacts by
endogenous biotin exposure and a detection kit based on the labeled
streptavidin biotin (LSAB) method. Thereby, we also employed 3% hydrogen
peroxide(H2O2) for the inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity and
incubated the tissue sections with the biotinylated secondary antibody at room
temperature (RT). We now add the immunohistochemical details that had led us to
this optimized procedure as they also bear a more general relevance when
demonstrating intracellular tissue antigens. Our most important result is that
endogenous peroxidase inhibition by 0.3% H2O2 coincided with an apparently
positive IDE staining in an investigated breast cancer specimen whereas
combining a block by 3% H2O2 with an incubation of the biotinylated secondary
antibody at RT, yet not at 37 degrees Celsius, revealed this specimen as almost
entirely IDE-negative. Our present data caution against three different
immunohistochemical pitfalls that might cause falsely positive results and
artifacts when using an LSAB- and peroxidase-based detection method: pressure
cooking for AR, insufficient quenching of endogenous peroxidases and heating of
tissue sections while incubating with biotinylated secondary antibodies.
  In recent years, several authors have used probabilistic graphical models to
learn expression modules and their regulatory programs from gene expression
data. Here, we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator SynTReN for
the purpose of testing and comparing module network learning algorithms. We
introduce a software package for learning module networks, called LeMoNe, which
incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs. Novelties
include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct
the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign
regulators to the regulation program nodes. Using SynTReN data, we test the
performance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the
effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing
software package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of
various parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise,
on the inference performance. Overall, application of Genomica and LeMoNe to
simulated data sets gave comparable results. However, LeMoNe offers some
advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster
for larger data sets. Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators
in the LeMoNe regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to
prioritize regulators for functional validation, and that the combination of
the bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment
of regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden regulators.
  The classical approach to protein folding inspired by statistical mechanics
avoids the high dimensional structure of the conformation space by using
effective coordinates. Here we introduce a network approach to capture the
statistical properties of the structure of conformation spaces. Conformations
are represented as nodes of the network, while links are transitions via
elementary rotations around a chemical bond. Self-avoidance of a polypeptide
chain introduces degree correlations in the conformation network, which in turn
lead to energy landscape correlations. Folding can be interpreted as a biased
random walk on the conformation network. We show that the folding pathways
along energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thus
explaining previous observations made via molecular dynamics simulations. We
also show that these energy landscape correlations are essential for recovering
the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality
class than that of random energy models. In addition, we predict that the
exponent and therefore the structure of the folding network fundamentally
changes at high temperatures, as verified by our simulations on the AK peptide.
  We have developed a linearization method to investigate the subthreshold
oscillatory behaviors in nonlinear autonomous systems. By considering firstly
the neuronal system as an example, we show that this theoretical approach can
predict quantitatively the subthreshold oscillatory activities, including the
damping coefficients and the oscillatory frequencies which are in good
agreement with those observed in experiments. Then we generalize the
linearization method to an arbitrary autonomous nonlinear system. The detailed
extension of this theoretical approach is also presented and further discussed.
  The widespread use of genetic testing in high risk pregnancies has created
strong interest in rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics for common
chromosomal aneuploidies. We show here that digital polymerase chain reaction
(dPCR) can be used for accurate measurement of trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome),
the most common human aneuploidy. dPCR is generally applicable to any
aneuploidy, does not depend on allelic distribution or gender, and is able to
detect signals in the presence of mosaics or contaminating maternal DNA.
  We consider a probabilistic cellular automaton to analyze the stochastic
dynamics of a predator-prey system. The local rules are Markovian and are based
in the Lotka-Volterra model. The individuals of each species reside on the
sites of a lattice and interact with an unsymmetrical neighborhood. We look for
the effect of the space anisotropy in the characterization of the oscillations
of the species population densities. Our study of the probabilistic cellular
automaton is based on simple and pair mean-field approximations and explicitly
takes into account spatial anisotropy.
  Hayashi and Carthew (Nature 431 [2004], 647) have shown that the packing of
cone cells in the Drosophila retina resembles soap bubble packing, and that
changing E- and N-cadherin expression can change this packing, as well as cell
shape.
  The analogy with bubbles suggests that cell packing is driven by surface
minimization. We find that this assumption is insufficient to model the
experimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherin
expression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surface
increase, balanced by cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally
observed distributions of E- and N-cadherin, we simulate the packing and cell
shapes in the wildtype eye. Furthermore, by changing only the corresponding
parameters, this model can describe the mutants with different numbers of
cells, or changes in cadherin expression.
  Invited contribution to "Quantum Aspects of Life", D. Abbott Ed. (World
Scientific, Singapore, 2007).
  The present paper introduces an original biofeedback system for improving
human balance control, whose underlying principle consists in providing
additional sensory information related to foot sole pressure distribution to
the user through a tongue-placed tactile output device. To assess the effect of
this biofeedback system on postural control during quiet standing, ten young
healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible with their eyes
closed in two conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Centre of foot
pressure (CoP) displacements were recorded using a force platform. Results
showed reduced CoP displacements in the Biofeedback relative to the
No-biofeedback condition. The present findings evidenced the ability of the
central nervous system to efficiently integrate an artificial plantar-based,
tongue-placed tactile biofeedback for controlling control posture during quiet
standing.
  A dynamical mean-field theory is developed to analyze stochastic single-cell
dynamics of gene expression. By explicitly taking account of nonequilibrium and
nonadiabatic features of the DNA state fluctuation, two-time correlation
functions and response functions of single-cell dynamics are derived. The
method is applied to a self-regulating gene to predict a rich variety of
dynamical phenomena such as anomalous increase of relaxation time and
oscillatory decay of correlations. Effective "temperature" defined as the ratio
of the correlation to the response in the protein number is small when the DNA
state change is frequent, while it grows large when the DNA state change is
infrequent, indicating the strong enhancement of noise in the latter case.
  We consider the asymptotic behaviour of the solution of one dimensional
stochastic differential equations and Langevin equations in periodic
backgrounds with zero average. We prove that in several such models, there is
generically a non vanishing asymptotic velocity, despite of the fact that the
average of the background is zero.
  This article reports about a novel extension of dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) that allows the study of the collective dynamics of complex chemical and
structural systems in a spatially resolved manner with a combinatorially
complex variety of different system constituents. We show that introducing
multipolar interactions between particles leads to extended membrane structures
emerging in a self-organized manner and exhibiting both the necessary
mechanical stability for transport and fluidity so as to provide a
two-dimensional self-organizing dynamic reaction environment for kinetic
studies in the context of cell biology. We further show that the emergent
dynamics of extended membrane bound objects is in accordance with scaling laws
imposed by physics.
  We propose that genetic encoding of self-assembling components greatly
enhances the evolution of complex systems and provides an efficient platform
for inductive generalization, i.e. the inductive derivation of a solution to a
problem with a potentially infinite number of instances from a limited set of
test examples. We exemplify this in simulations by evolving scalable circuitry
for several problems. One of them, digital multiplication, has been intensively
studied in recent years, where hitherto the evolutionary design of only
specific small multipliers was achieved. The fact that this and other problems
can be solved in full generality employing self-assembly sheds light on the
evolutionary role of self-assembly in biology and is of relevance for the
design of complex systems in nano- and bionanotechnology.
  A basic question of protein structural studies is to which extent mutations
affect the stability. This question may be addressed starting from sequence
and/or from structure. In proteomics and genomics studies prediction of protein
stability free energy change (DDG) upon single point mutation may also help the
annotation process. The experimental SSG values are affected by uncertainty as
measured by standard deviations. Most of the DDG values are nearly zero (about
32% of the DDG data set ranges from -0.5 to 0.5 Kcal/mol) and both the value
and sign of DDG may be either positive or negative for the same mutation
blurring the relationship among mutations and expected DDG value. In order to
overcome this problem we describe a new predictor that discriminates between 3
mutation classes: destabilizing mutations (DDG<-0.5 Kcal/mol), stabilizing
mutations (DDG>0.5 Kcal/mol) and neutral mutations (-0.5<=DDG<=0.5 Kcal/mol).
In this paper a support vector machine starting from the protein sequence or
structure discriminates between stabilizing, destabilizing and neutral
mutations. We rank all the possible substitutions according to a three state
classification system and show that the overall accuracy of our predictor is as
high as 52% when performed starting from sequence information and 58% when the
protein structure is available, with a mean value correlation coefficient of
0.30 and 0.39, respectively. These values are about 20 points per cent higher
than those of a random predictor.
  We study a model ecosystem by means of dynamical techniques from disordered
systems theory. The model describes a set of species subject to competitive
interactions through a background of resources, which they feed upon.
Additionally direct competitive or co-operative interaction between species may
occur through a random coupling matrix. We compute the order parameters of the
system in a fixed point regime, and identify the onset of instability and
compute the phase diagram. We focus on the effects of variability of resources,
direct interaction between species, co-operation pressure and dilution on the
stability and the diversity of the ecosystem. It is shown that resources can be
exploited optimally only in absence of co-operation pressure or direct
interaction between species.
  Biologists are leading current research on genome characterization
(sequencing, alignment, transcription), providing a huge quantity of raw data
about many genome organisms. Extracting knowledge from this raw data is an
important process for biologists, using usually data mining approaches.
However, it is difficult to deals with these genomic information using actual
bioinformatics data mining tools, because data are heterogeneous, huge in
quantity and geographically distributed. In this paper, we present a new
approach between data mining and virtual reality visualization, called visual
data mining. Indeed Virtual Reality becomes ripe, with efficient display
devices and intuitive interaction in an immersive context. Moreover, biologists
use to work with 3D representation of their molecules, but in a desktop
context. We present a software solution, Genome3DExplorer, which addresses the
problem of genomic data visualization, of scene management and interaction.
This solution is based on a well-adapted graphical and interaction paradigm,
where local and global topological characteristics of data are easily visible,
on the contrary to traditional genomic database browsers, always focused on the
zoom and details level.
  A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying
simplicity in complex motor actions. Here we show that the space of shapes
adopted by the nematode C. elegans is surprisingly low dimensional, with just
four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially
reconstruct "equations of motion" for the dynamics in this space. These
dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a
rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.
Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can
generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the
worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively "steering" the
worm in real time.
  The self-propelled motion of microscopic bodies immersed in a fluid medium is
studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The advantage of the atomistic
approach is that the detailed level of description allows complete freedom in
specifying the swimmer design and its coupling with the surrounding fluid. A
series of two-dimensional swimming bodies employing a variety of propulsion
mechanisms -- motivated by biological and microrobotic designs -- is
investigated, including the use of moving limbs, changing body shapes and fluid
jets. The swimming efficiency and the nature of the induced, time-dependent
flow fields are found to differ widely among body designs and propulsion
mechanisms.
  Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure is closely related to genome
function, in particular transcription. However, the folding path of the
chromatin fiber in the interphase nucleus is unknown. Here, we systematically
measured the 3D physical distance between pairwise labeled genomic positions in
gene-dense, highly transcribed domains and gene-poor less active areas on
chromosomes 1 and 11 in G1 nuclei of human primary fibroblasts, using
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Interpretation of our results and those
published by others, based on polymer physics, shows that the folding of the
chromatin fiber can be described as a polymer in a globular state (GS),
maintained by intra-polymer attractive interactions that counteract
self-avoidance forces. The GS polymer model is able to describe chromatin
folding in as well the highly expressed domains as the lowly expressed ones,
indicating that they differ in Kuhn length and chromatin compaction. Each type
of genomic domain constitutes an ensemble of relatively compact globular
folding states, resulting in a considerable cellto- cell variation between
otherwise identical cells. We present evidence for different polymer folding
regimes of the chromatin fiber on the length scale of a few mega base pairs and
on that of complete chromosome arms (several tens of Mb). Our results present a
novel view on the folding of the chromatin fiber in interphase and open the
possibility to explore the nature of the intra-chromatin fiber interactions.
  The prediction of the three-dimensional native structure of proteins from the
knowledge of their amino acid sequence, known as the protein folding problem,
is one of the most important yet unsolved issues of modern science. Since the
conformational behaviour of flexible molecules is nothing more than a complex
physical problem, increasingly more physicists are moving into the study of
protein systems, bringing with them powerful mathematical and computational
tools, as well as the sharp intuition and deep images inherent to the physics
discipline. This work attempts to facilitate the first steps of such a
transition. In order to achieve this goal, we provide an exhaustive account of
the reasons underlying the protein folding problem enormous relevance and
summarize the present-day status of the methods aimed to solving it. We also
provide an introduction to the particular structure of these biological
heteropolymers, and we physically define the problem stating the assumptions
behind this (commonly implicit) definition. Finally, we review the 'special
flavor' of statistical mechanics that is typically used to study the
astronomically large phase spaces of macromolecules. Throughout the whole work,
much material that is found scattered in the literature has been put together
here to improve comprehension and to serve as a handy reference.
  We investigate the effects of risk perception in a simple model of epidemic
spreading. We assume that the perception of the risk of being infected depends
on the fraction of neighbors that are ill. The effect of this factor is to
decrease the infectivity, that therefore becomes a dynamical component of the
model. We study the problem in the mean-field approximation and by numerical
simulations for regular, random and scale-free networks.
  We show that for homogeneous and random networks, there is always a value of
perception that stops the epidemics. In the ``worst-case'' scenario of a
scale-free network with diverging input connectivity, a linear perception
cannot stop the epidemics; however we show that a non-linear increase of the
perception risk may lead to the extinction of the disease. This transition is
discontinuous, and is not predicted by the mean-field analysis.
  We report a first in modeling and simulation of the effects of the HIV
proteins on the (caspase dependent) apoptotic pathway in infected cells. This
work is novel and is an extension on the recent reports and clarifications on
the FAS apoptotic pathway from the literature. We have gathered most of the
reaction rates and initial conditions from the literature, the rest of the
constants have been computed by fitting our model to the experimental results
reported. Using the model obtained we have then run the simulations for the
infected memory T cells, called also latent T cells, which, at the moment,
represent the major obstacle to finding a cure for HIV. We can now report that
the infected latent T cells have an estimated lifetime of about 42 hours from
the moment they are re-activated. As far as we know this is the first result of
this type obtained for the infected memory T cells.
  We construct a unifying theory of geometric effects in mesoscopic stochastic
kinetics. We demonstrate that the adiabatic pump and the reversible ratchet
effects, as well as similar new phenomena in other domains, such as in
epidemiology, all follow from geometric phase contributions to the effective
action in the stochastic path integral representation of the moment generating
function. The theory provides the universal technique for identification,
prediction and calculation of pump-like phenomena in an arbitrary mesoscopic
stochastic framework.
  Random networks with specified degree distributions have been proposed as
realistic models of population structure, yet the problem of dynamically
modeling SIR-type epidemics in random networks remains complex. I resolve this
dilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three
nonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function
(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network
and makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a
well-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of
infecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating
between network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic
incidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the
evolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The
equations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree
distribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with
which it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are
observed to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller
final size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson.
The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement
with the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of
determining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to
occur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.
  Contact patterns in populations fundamentally influence the spread of
infectious diseases. Current mathematical methods for epidemiological
forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals are
fixed, at least for the duration of an outbreak. In reality, contact patterns
may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and breaking social or
sexual relationships. Here we develop a mathematical approach to predicting
disease transmission on dynamic networks in which each individual has a
characteristic behavior (typical contact number), but the identities of their
contacts change in time. We show that dynamic contact patterns shape
epidemiological dynamics in ways that cannot be adequately captured in static
network models or mass-action models. Our new model interpolates smoothly
between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter,
thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models.
Using epidemiological and sexual contact data from an Atlanta high school, we
then demonstrate the utility of this method for forecasting and controlling
sexually transmitted disease outbreaks.
  We analytically and numerically study the probabilistic properties of
inverted and mirror repeats in model sequences of nucleic acids. We consider
both perfect and non-perfect repeats, i.e. repeats with mismatches and gaps.
The considered sequence models are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
sequences, Markov processes and long range sequences. We show that the number
of repeats in correlated sequences is significantly larger than in i.i.d.
sequences and that this discrepancy increases exponentially with the repeat
length for long range sequences.
  We present a model improving the two-angle model for interphase chromatin
(E2A model). This model takes into account the cylindrical shape of the histone
octamers, the H1 histones in front of the nucleosomes and the vertical distance
$d$ between the in and outgoing DNA strands. Factoring these chromatin features
in, one gets essential changes in the chromatin phase diagram: Not only the
shape of the excluded-volume borderline changes but also the vertical distance
$d$ has a dramatic influence on the forbidden area. Furthermore, we examined
the influence of H1 defects on the properties of the chromatin fiber. Thus we
present two possible strategies for chromatin compaction: The use of very dense
states in the phase diagram in the gaps in the excluded volume borderline or
missing H1 histones which can lead to very compact fibers. The chromatin fiber
might use both of these mechanisms to compact itself at least locally. Line
densities computed within the model coincident with the experimental values.
  We suggest a simple deterministic approximation for the growth of the
favoured-allele frequency during a selective sweep. Using this approximation we
introduce an accurate model for genetic hitch-hiking. Only when Ns < 10 (N is
the population size and s denotes the selection coefficient), are discrepancies
between our approximation and direct numerical simulations of a Moran model
noticeable. Our model describes the gene genealogies of a contiguous segment of
neutral loci close to the selected one, and it does not assume that the
selective sweep happens instantaneously. This enables us to compute SNP
distributions on the neutral segment without bias.
  Both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate the
repression of specific sequences of mRNA through the RNA interference pathway.
In the last years several experiments have supported the hypothesis that siRNAs
and miRNAs may be functionally interchangeable, at least in cultured cells. In
this work we verify that this hypothesis is also supported by a computational
evidence. We show that a method specifically trained to predict the activity of
the exogenous siRNAs assigns a high silencing level to experimentally
determined human miRNAs. This result not only supports the idea of siRNAs and
miRNAs equivalence but indicates that it is possible to use computational tools
developed using synthetic small interference RNAs to investigate endogenous
miRNAs.
  In this paper, we present a method to optimise rough set partition sizes, to
which rule extraction is performed on HIV data. The genetic algorithm
optimisation technique is used to determine the partition sizes of a rough set
in order to maximise the rough sets prediction accuracy. The proposed method is
tested on a set of demographic properties of individuals obtained from the
South African antenatal survey. Six demographic variables were used in the
analysis, these variables are; race, age of mother, education, gravidity,
parity, and age of father, with the outcome or decision being either HIV
positive or negative. Rough set theory is chosen based on the fact that it is
easy to interpret the extracted rules. The prediction accuracy of equal width
bin partitioning is 57.7% while the accuracy achieved after optimising the
partitions is 72.8%. Several other methods have been used to analyse the HIV
data and their results are stated and compared to that of rough set theory
(RST).
  A synfire chain is a simple neural network model which can propagate stable
synchronous spikes called a pulse packet and widely researched. However how
synfire chains coexist in one network remains to be elucidated. We have studied
the activity of a layered associative network of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
neurons in which connection we embed memory patterns by the Hebbian Learning.
We analyzed their activity by the Fokker-Planck method. In our previous report,
when a half of neurons belongs to each memory pattern (memory pattern rate
$F=0.5$), the temporal profiles of the network activity is split into
temporally clustered groups called sublattices under certain input conditions.
In this study, we show that when the network is sparsely connected ($F<0.5$),
synchronous firings of the memory pattern are promoted. On the contrary, the
densely connected network ($F>0.5$) inhibit synchronous firings. The sparseness
and denseness also effect the basin of attraction and the storage capacity of
the embedded memory patterns. We show that the sparsely(densely) connected
networks enlarge(shrink) the basion of attraction and increase(decrease) the
storage capacity.
  Analyzing nonlinear conformational relaxation dynamics in elastic networks
corresponding to two classical motor proteins, we find that they respond by
well-defined internal mechanical motions to various initial deformations and
that these motions are robust against external perturbations. We show that this
behavior is not characteristic for random elastic networks. However, special
network architectures with such properties can be designed by evolutionary
optimization methods. Using them, an example of an artificial elastic network,
operating as a cyclic machine powered by ligand binding, is constructed.
  Molecular spiders are synthetic bio-molecular systems which have "legs" made
of short single-stranded segments of DNA. Spiders move on a surface covered
with single-stranded DNA segments complementary to legs. Different mappings are
established between various models of spiders and simple exclusion processes.
For spiders with simple gait and varying number of legs we compute the
diffusion coefficient; when the hopping is biased we also compute their
velocity.
  Synthetic bio-molecular spiders with "legs" made of single-stranded segments
of DNA can move on a surface which is also covered by single-stranded segments
of DNA complementary to the leg DNA. In experimental realizations, when a leg
detaches from a segment of the surface for the first time it alters that
segment, and legs subsequently bound to these altered segments more weakly.
Inspired by these experiments we investigate spiders moving along a
one-dimensional substrate, whose legs leave newly visited sites at a slower
rate than revisited sites. For a random walk (one-leg spider) the slowdown does
not effect the long time behavior. For a bipedal spider, however, the slowdown
generates an effective bias towards unvisited sites, and the spider behaves
similarly to the excited walk. Surprisingly, the slowing down of the spider at
new sites increases the diffusion coefficient and accelerates the growth of the
number of visited sites.
  It has been shown that differences in fecundity variance can influence the
probability of invasion of a genotype in a population, i.e. a genotype with
lower variance in offspring number can be favored in finite populations even if
it has a somewhat lower mean fitness than a competitor. In this paper,
Gillespie's results are extended to population genetic systems with explicit
age structure, where the demographic variance (variance in growth rate)
calculated in the work of Engen and colleagues is used as a generalization of
"variance in offspring number" to predict the interaction between deterministic
and random forces driving change in allele frequency. By calculating the
variance from the life history parameters, it is shown that selection against
variance in the growth rate will favor a genotypes with lower stochasticity in
age specific survival and fertility rates. A diffusion approximation for
selection and drift in a population with two genotypes with different life
history matrices (and therefore, different growth rates and demographic
variances) is derived and shown to be consistent with individual based
simulations. It is also argued that for finite populations, perturbation
analyses of both the growth rate and demographic variances may be necessary to
determine the sensitivity of "fitness" (broadly defined) to changes in the life
history parameters.
  Motivation: Similarity-measure based clustering is a crucial problem
appearing throughout scientific data analysis. Recently, a powerful new
algorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques
was proposed by Frey and Dueck \cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified
by a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and
exemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its
present form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having
exactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped
clusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene
expression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP
hard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints
compared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to
interpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest
neighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint
affinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to
more stable clustering. Even though a new {\it a priori} free-parameter is
introduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is
reduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter
selection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,
including in particular microarray data related to various cancer types. We
show that the algorithm efficiently unveils the hierarchical cluster structure
present in the data sets. Further on, it allows to extract sparse gene
expression signatures for each cluster.
  With an automatic image analysis device, we studied the temporal distribution
of the locomotor activity of E. orientalis and E. vuilleti during 24 h, and
over several days to know whether the activity rhythms of these two Eupelmidae
play a role in their competitive interactions. The analysis of locomotor
activity rhythms of E. orientalis and E. vuilleti shows that the locomotor
activity of both species presents daily cyclic variations. These two Eupelmidae
have similar activity rhythms. Displacements of these parasitoids essentially
take place during the photophase. But the activity of E. vuilleti is earlier,
because the individuals of this species start their activity on average 4 to 5
h earlier than those of E. orientalis. E. vuilleti begins its displacements
several hours before the onset of lighting, whereas E. orientalis is active
only in the presence of the light. This shift of starting activity is thus a
factor allowing these concurrent species to minimize their interactions during
the cohabitation period in traditional granaries after the harvests of cowpea.
  There are many processes in biology in which mechanical forces are generated.
Force-bearing networks can transduce locally developed mechanical signals very
extensively over different parts of the cell or tissues. In this article we
conduct an overview of this kind of mechanical transduction, focusing in
particular on the multiple layers of complexity displayed by the mechanisms
that control and trigger the conversion of a mechanical signal into a
biochemical function. Single molecule methodologies, through their capability
to introduce the force in studies of biological processes in which mechanical
stresses are developed, are unveiling subtle intertwining mechanisms between
chemistry and mechanics and in particular are revealing how chemistry can
control mechanics. The possibility that chemistry interplays with mechanics
should be always considered in biochemical studies.
  In Chile and Uruguay,the gregarious Pteromalidae (Monoksa dorsiplana) has
been discovered emerging from seeds of the persistent pods of Acacia caven
attacked by the univoltin bruchid Pseudopachymeria spinipes. We investigated
the potential for mass rearing of this gregarious ectoparasitoid on an
alternative bruchid host, Callosobruchus maculatus, to use it against the
bruchidae of native and cultured species of Leguminosea seeds in South America.
The mass rearing of M.dorsiplana was carried out in a population cage where the
density of egg-laying females per infested seed was increased from 1:1 on the
first day to 5:1 on the last (fifth) day. Under these experimental conditions
egg-clutch size per host increased, and at the same time the mortality of eggs
laid also increased. The density of egg-laying females influenced the sex ratio
which tended towards a balance of sons and daughters,in contrast to the sex
ratio of a single egg-laying female per host (1 son to 7 daughters). The mean
weight of adults emerging from a parasitized host was negatively correlated
with the egg-clutch size, i.e., as egg-clutch size increased, adult weight
decreased. All these results show that mass rearing of the gregarious
ectoparasitoid M.dorsiplana was possible under laboratory conditions on an
alternative bruchid host C.maculatus. As M.dorsiplana is a natural enemy of
larval and pupal stages of bruchidae, the next step was to investigate whether
the biological control of bruchid C.maculatus was possible in an experimental
structure of stored beans.
  A phase field model for dealing with shape instabilities in fluid membrane
vesicles is presented. This model takes into account the Canham-Helfrich
bending energy with spontaneous curvature. A dynamic equation for the
phase-field is also derived. With this model it is possible to see the vesicle
shape deformation dynamically, when some external agent instabilizes the
membrane, for instance, inducing an inhomogeneous spontaneous curvature. The
numerical scheme used is detailed and some stationary shapes are shown together
with a shape diagram for vesicles of spherical topology and no spontaneous
curvature, in agreement with known results.
  A mathematical model of infiltrative tumour growth taking into account cell
proliferation, death and motility is considered. The model is formulated in
terms of local cell density and nutrient (oxygen) concentration. In the model
the rate of cell death depends on the local nutrient level. Thus heterogeneous
nutrient distribution in tissue affects tumour structure and development. The
existence of automodel solutions is demonstrated and their properties are
investigated. The results are compared to the properties of the
Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov and Fisher equations. Influence of the nutrient
distribution on the autowave speed selection as well as on the relaxation to
automodel solution is demonstrated. The model adequately describes the data,
observed in experiments.
  The stability of the dynamical states characterized by a uniform firing rate
({\it splay states}) is analyzed in a network of globally coupled leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. This is done by reducing the set of differential
equations to a map that is investigated in the limit of large network size. We
show that the stability of the splay state depends crucially on the ratio
between the pulse--width and the inter-spike interval. More precisely, the
spectrum of Floquet exponents turns out to consist of three components: (i) one
that coincides with the predictions of the mean-field analysis [Abbott-van
Vreesvijk, 1993]; (ii) a component measuring the instability of
"finite-frequency" modes; (iii) a number of "isolated" eigenvalues that are
connected to the characteristics of the single pulse and may give rise to
strong instabilities (the Floquet exponent being proportional to the network
size). Finally, as a side result, we find that the splay state can be stable
even for inhibitory coupling.
  The metabolic networks are very well characterized for a large set of
organisms, a unique case in within the large-scale biological networks. For
this reason they provide a a very interesting framework for the construction of
analytically tractable statistical mechanics models.
  In this paper we introduce a solvable model for the distribution of fluxes in
the metabolic network. We show that the effect of the topology on the
distribution of fluxes is to allow for large fluctuations of their values, a
fact that should have implications on the robustness of the system.
  We investigate the mechanisms of histone sliding and detachment with a
stochastic model that couples thermally-induced, passive histone sliding with
active motor-driven histone unwrapping. Analysis of a passive loop or twist
defect-mediated histone sliding mechanism shows that diffusional sliding is
enhanced as larger portions of the DNA is peeled off the histone. The mean
times to histone detachment and the mean distance traveled by the motor complex
prior to histone detachment are computed as functions of the intrinsic speed of
the motor. Fast motors preferentially induce detachment over sliding. However,
for a fixed motor speed, increasing the histone-DNA affinity (and thereby
decreasing the passive sliding rate) increases the mean distance traveled by
the motor.
  Background: Information processing in the brain requires large amounts of
metabolic energy, the spatial distribution of which is highly heterogeneous
reflecting complex activity patterns in the mammalian brain.
  Results: Here, it is found based on empirical data that, despite this
heterogeneity, the volume-specific cerebral glucose metabolic rate of many
different brain structures scales with brain volume with almost the same
exponent around -0.15. The exception is white matter, the metabolism of which
seems to scale with a standard specific exponent -1/4. The scaling exponents
for the total oxygen and glucose consumptions in the brain in relation to its
volume are identical and equal to $0.86\pm 0.03$, which is significantly larger
than the exponents 3/4 and 2/3 suggested for whole body basal metabolism on
body mass.
  Conclusions: These findings show explicitly that in mammals (i)
volume-specific scaling exponents of the cerebral energy expenditure in
different brain parts are approximately constant (except brain stem
structures), and (ii) the total cerebral metabolic exponent against brain
volume is greater than the much-cited Kleiber's 3/4 exponent. The
neurophysiological factors that might account for the regional uniformity of
the exponents and for the excessive scaling of the total brain metabolism are
discussed, along with the relationship between brain metabolic scaling and
computation.
  This paper presents a stability test for a class of interconnected nonlinear
systems motivated by biochemical reaction networks. One of the main results
determines global asymptotic stability of the network from the diagonal
stability of a "dissipativity matrix" which incorporates information about the
passivity properties of the subsystems, the interconnection structure of the
network, and the signs of the interconnection terms. This stability test
encompasses the "secant criterion" for cyclic networks presented in our
previous paper, and extends it to a general interconnection structure
represented by a graph. A second main result allows one to accommodate state
products. This extension makes the new stability criterion applicable to a
broader class of models, even in the case of cyclic systems. The new stability
test is illustrated on a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade model,
and on a branched interconnection structure motivated by metabolic networks.
Finally, another result addresses the robustness of stability in the presence
of diffusion terms in a compartmental system made out of identical systems.
  The behavior of interacting populations typically displays irregular temporal
and spatial patterns that are difficult to reconcile with an underlying
deterministic dynamics. A classical example is the heterogeneous distribution
of plankton communities, which has been observed to be patchy over a wide range
of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we use plankton communities as prototype
systems to present theoretical approaches for the analysis of the combined
effects of turbulent advection and stochastic growth in the spatiotemporal
dynamics of the population. Incorporation of these two factors into
mathematical models brings an extra level of realism to the description and
leads to better agreement with experimental data than that of previously
proposed models based on reaction-diffusion equations.
  The equilibrium free energy landscape of an off-lattice model protein as a
function of an internal (reaction) coordinate is reconstructed from
out-of-equilibrium mechanical unfolding manipulations. This task is
accomplished via two independent methods: by employing an extended version of
the Jarzynski equality (EJE) and the protein inherent structures (ISs). In a
range of temperatures around the ``folding transition'' we find a good
quantitative agreement between the free energies obtained via EJE and IS
approaches. This indicates that the two methodologies are consistent and able
to reproduce equilibrium properties of the examined system. Moreover, for the
studied model the structural transitions induced by pulling can be related to
thermodynamical aspects of folding.
  From the spectral plot of the (normalized) graph Laplacian, the essential
qualitative properties of a network can be simultaneously deduced. Given a
class of empirical networks, reconstruction schemes for elucidating the
evolutionary dynamics leading to those particular data can then be developed.
This method is exemplified for protein-protein interaction networks. Traces of
their evolutionary history of duplication and divergence processes are
identified. In particular, we can identify typical specific features that
robustly distinguish protein-protein interaction networks from other classes of
networks, in spite of possible statistical fluctuations of the underlying data.
  Mechanistic home range models are important tools in modeling animal dynamics
in spatially-complex environments. We introduce a class of stochastic models
for animal movement in a habitat of varying preference. Such models interpolate
between spatially-implicit resource selection analysis (RSA) and
advection-diffusion models, possessing these two models as limiting cases. We
find a closed-form solution for the steady-state (equilibrium) probability
distribution u* using a factorization of the redistribution operator into
symmetric and diagonal parts. How space use is controlled by the preference
function w then depends on the characteristic width of the redistribution
kernel: when w changes rapidly compared to this width, u* ~ w, whereas on
global scales large compared to this width, u* ~ w^2. We analyse the behavior
at discontinuities in w which occur at habitat type boundaries. We simulate the
dynamics of space use given two-dimensional prey-availability data and explore
the effect of the redistribution kernel width. Our factorization allows such
numerical simulations to be done extremely fast; we expect this to aid the
computationally-intensive task of model parameter fitting and inverse modeling.
  In this paper we describe a new technique for the comparison of populations
of DNA strands. Comparison is vital to the study of ecological systems, at both
the micro and macro scales. Existing methods make use of DNA sequencing and
cloning, which can prove costly and time consuming, even with current
sequencing techniques. Our overall objective is to address questions such as:
(i) (Genome detection) Is a known genome sequence present, at least in part, in
an environmental sample? (ii) (Sequence query) Is a specific fragment sequence
present in a sample? (iii) (Similarity discovery) How similar in terms of
sequence content are two unsequenced samples? We propose a method involving
multiple filtering criteria that result in "pools" of DNA of high or very high
purity. Because our method is similar in spirit to hashing in computer science,
we call it DNA hash pooling. To illustrate this method, we describe protocols
using pairs of restriction enzymes. The in silico empirical results we present
reflect a sensitivity to experimental error. Our method will normally be
performed as a filtering step prior to sequencing in order to reduce the amount
of sequencing required (generally by a factor of 10 or more). Even as
sequencing becomes cheaper, an order of magnitude remains important.
  We investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between microorganisms swimming
at low Reynolds number. By considering simple model swimmers, and combining
analytic and numerical approaches, we investigate the time-averaged flow field
around a swimmer. At short distances the swimmer behaves like a pump. At large
distances the velocity field depends on whether the swimming stroke is
invariant under a combined time-reversal and parity transformation. We then
consider two swimmers and find that the interaction between them consists of
two parts; a dead term, independent of the motion of the second swimmer, which
takes the expected dipolar form and a live term resulting from the simultaneous
swimming action of both swimmers which does not. We argue that, in general, the
latter dominates. The swimmer--swimmer interaction is a complicated function of
their relative displacement, orientation and phase, leading to motion that can
be attractive, repulsive or oscillatory.
  We consider two seemingly very different self-assembly processes: formation
of viral capsids, and crystallization of sticky discs. At low temperatures,
assembly is ineffective, since there are many metastable disordered states,
which are a source of kinetic frustration. We use fluctuation-dissipation
ratios to extract information about the degree of this frustration. We show
that our analysis is a useful indicator of the long term fate of the system,
based on the early stages of assembly.
  We present a mathematical analysis of the effects of Hebbian learning in
random recurrent neural networks, with a generic Hebbian learning rule
including passive forgetting and different time scales for neuronal activity
and learning dynamics. Previous numerical works have reported that Hebbian
learning drives the system from chaos to a steady state through a sequence of
bifurcations. Here, we interpret these results mathematically and show that
these effects, involving a complex coupling between neuronal dynamics and
synaptic graph structure, can be analyzed using Jacobian matrices, which
introduce both a structural and a dynamical point of view on the neural network
evolution. Furthermore, we show that the sensitivity to a learned pattern is
maximal when the largest Lyapunov exponent is close to 0. We discuss how neural
networks may take advantage of this regime of high functional interest.
  A spontaneously active neural system that is capable of continual learning
should also be capable of homeostasis of both firing rate and connectivity.
Experimental evidence suggests that both types of homeostasis exist, and that
connectivity is maintained at a state that is optimal for information
transmission and storage. This state is referred to as the critical state. We
present a simple stochastic computational Hebbian learning model that
incorporates both firing rate and critical homeostasis, and we explore its
stability and connectivity properties. We also examine the behavior of our
model with a simulated seizure and with simulated acute deafferentation. We
argue that a neural system that is more highly connected than the critical
state (i.e., one that is "supercritical") is epileptogenic. Based on our
simulations, we predict that the post-seizural and post-deafferentation states
should be supercritical and epileptogenic. Furthermore, interventions that
boost spontaneous activity should be protective against epileptogenesis.
  In this paper, we present a spatial version of phytoplankton-zooplankton
model that includes some important factors such as external periodic forces,
noise, and diffusion processes. The spatially extended
phytoplankton-zooplankton system is from the original study by Scheffer [M
Scheffer, Fish and nutrients interplay determines algal biomass: a minimal
model, Oikos \textbf{62} (1991) 271-282]. Our results show that the spatially
extended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena.
The system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a
constructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the
oscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in
the space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the
external periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially
homogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are
observed in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are
both turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4:1 frequency-locking transform
into 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased. In addition to
elucidating our results outside the domain of Turing instability, we provide
further analysis of Turing linear stability with the help of the numerical
calculation by using the Maple software. Significantly, oscillations are
enhanced in the system when the noise term presents. These results indicate
that the oceanic plankton bloom may partly due to interplay between the
stochastic factors and external forces instead of deterministic factors. These
results also may help us to understand the effects arising from undeniable
subject to random fluctuations in oceanic plankton bloom.
  Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in vivo display intense
subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) activity. The power spectral density (PSD)
of the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a
slope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by
traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on
reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close
to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is
"short-circuited" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which
may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable
equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged
instantaneously. We show that the resulting "non-ideal" cable model can be
solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a
ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency
scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using
non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of
high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation
in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal
capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high
frequencies.
  In this work we develop a microscopic physical model of early evolution,
where phenotype,organism life expectancy, is directly related to genotype, the
stability of its proteins in their native conformations which can be determined
exactly in the model. Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently
observe the Big Bang scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as
soon as favorable sequence-structure combinations (precursors of stable
proteins) are discovered. Upon that, random diversity of the structural space
abruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that
protein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at time scales much
greater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the
lifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law.
The separation of evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and
generation of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and
superfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same
distributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence
of species, subpopulations which carry similar genomes. Further we present a
simple theory that relates stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of
emerging genomes. Together, these results provide a microscopic first
principles picture of how first gene families developed in the course of early
evolution
  Molecular biology is a nanotechnology that works--it has worked for billions
of years and in an amazing variety of circumstances. At its core is a system
for acquiring, processing and communicating information that is universal, from
viruses and bacteria to human beings. Advances in genetics and experience in
designing computers have taken us to a stage where we can understand the
optimisation principles at the root of this system, from the availability of
basic building blocks to the execution of tasks. The languages of DNA and
proteins are argued to be the optimal solutions to the information processing
tasks they carry out. The analysis also suggests simpler predecessors to these
languages, and provides fascinating clues about their origin. Obviously, a
comprehensive unraveling of the puzzle of life would have a lot to say about
what we may design or convert ourselves into.
  This paper develops a mathematical model describing the influence that
conjugation-mediated Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) has on the
mutation-selection balance in an asexually reproducing population of
unicellular, prokaryotic organisms. It is assumed that mutation-selection
balance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of
antibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive.
We analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high
antibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest
mean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of
conjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and
then rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation
becomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean
fitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the
mean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges
we have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due
to the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the
antibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the
behavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations.
The results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly
deleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection
balance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing
for faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this
paper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by
environmental stresses on a population.
  The problem of reconstructing and identifying intracellular protein signaling
and biochemical networks is of critical importance in biology today. We sought
to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one
of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology
today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade.
More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for
the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE)
networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions.
Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals
of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the
representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with
random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse
representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by
random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large
error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction
allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to
detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when
moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the
performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch
briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach.
  Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without
considering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles
encode. Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be
inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption
that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a
lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes
can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma dimensional hypercube
with adsorbing boundaries which are determined, in each dimension, by loss of a
protein stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences.
Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on
point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein
stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental
relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size and thermodynamic response
of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate
of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal
mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately 6 mutations per essential
part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and 1 to 2 mutations
per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Further, our results suggest
that in absence of error correction, modern RNA viruses and primordial genomes
must necessarily be very short. Several RNA viruses function close to the
evolutionary speed limit while error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses
and non-mutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and
mutation rates have brought these organisms universally about 1000 fold below
the natural speed limit.
  The number of fixed mutations accumulated in an evolving population often
displays a variance that is significantly larger than the mean (the
overdispersed molecular clock). By examining a generic evolutionary process on
a neutral network of high-fitness genotypes, we establish a formalism for
computing all cumulants of the full probability distribution of accumulated
mutations in terms of graph properties of the neutral network, and use the
formalism to prove overdispersion of the molecular clock. We further show that
significant overdispersion arises naturally in evolution when the neutral
network is highly sparse, exhibits large global fluctuations in neutrality, and
small local fluctuations in neutrality. The results are also relevant for
elucidating the topological structure of a neutral network from empirical
measurements of the substitution process.
  In a recent paper, Marr, Muller-Linow and Hutt [Phys. Rev. E 75, 041917
(2007)] investigate an artificial dynamic system on metabolic networks. They
find a less complex time evolution of this dynamic system in real networks,
compared to networks of reference models. The authors argue that this suggests
that metabolic network structure is a major factor behind the stability of
biochemical steady states. We reanalyze the same kind of data using a dynamic
system modeling actual reaction kinetics. The conclusions about stability, from
our analysis, are inconsistent with those of Marr et al. We argue that this
issue calls for a more detailed type of modeling.
  Recently Supernova 2006gy was noted as the most luminous ever recorded, with
a total radiated energy of ~10^44 Joules. It was proposed that the progenitor
may have been a massive evolved star similar to eta Carinae, which resides in
our own galaxy at a distance of about 2.3 kpc. eta Carinae appears ready to
detonate. Although it is too distant to pose a serious threat as a normal
supernova, and given its rotation axis is unlikely to produce a Gamma-Ray Burst
oriented toward the Earth, eta Carinae is about 30,000 times nearer than
2006gy, and we re-evaluate it as a potential superluminous supernova. We find
that given the large ratio of emission in the optical to the X-ray, atmospheric
effects are negligible. Ionization of the atmosphere and concomitant ozone
depletion are unlikely to be important. Any cosmic ray effects should be spread
out over ~10^4 y, and similarly unlikely to produce any serious perturbation to
the biosphere. We also discuss a new possible effect of supernovae, endocrine
disruption induced by blue light near the peak of the optical spectrum. This is
a possibility for nearby supernovae at distances too large to be considered
"dangerous" for other reasons. However, due to reddening and extinction by the
interstellar medium, eta Carinae is unlikely to trigger such effects to any
significant degree.
  Recent in vitro data show that neurons respond to input variance with varying
sensitivities. Here, we demonstrate that Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons can
operate in two computational regimes, one that is more sensitive to input
variance (differentiating) and one that is less sensitive (integrating). A
boundary plane in the 3D conductance space separates these two regimes. For a
reduced HH model, this plane can be derived analytically from the V nullcline,
thus suggesting a means of relating biophysical parameters to neural
computation by analyzing the neuron's dynamical system.
  In this paper we apply new geometric and combinatorial methods to the study
of phylogenetic mixtures. The focus of the geometric approach is to describe
the geometry of phylogenetic mixture distributions for the two state random
cluster model, which is a generalization of the two state symmetric (CFN)
model. In particular, we show that the set of mixture distributions forms a
convex polytope and we calculate its dimension; corollaries include a simple
criterion for when a mixture of branch lengths on the star tree can mimic the
site pattern frequency vector of a resolved quartet tree. Furthermore, by
computing volumes of polytopes we can clarify how ``common'' non-identifiable
mixtures are under the CFN model. We also present a new combinatorial result
which extends any identifiability result for a specific pair of trees of size
six to arbitrary pairs of trees. Next we present a positive result showing
identifiability of rates-across-sites models. Finally, we answer a question
raised in a previous paper concerning ``mixed branch repulsion'' on trees
larger than quartet trees under the CFN model.
  Mortality, birth rates and retirement play a major role in demographic
changes. In most cases, mortality rates decreased in the past century without
noticeable decrease in fertility rates, this leads to a significant increase in
population growth. In many poor countries like Palestinian territories the
number of births has fallen and the life expectancy increased.
  In this article we concentrate on measuring, analyzing and extrapolating the
age structure in Palestine a few decades ago into future. A Fortran program has
been designed and used for the simulation and analysis of our statistical data.
This study of demographic change in Palestine has shown that Palestinians will
have in future problems as the strongest age cohorts are the above-60-year
olds. We therefore recommend the increase of both the retirement age and women
employment.
  A novel approach to protein multiple sequence alignment is discussed:
substantially this method counterparts with substitution matrix based methods
(like Blosum or PAM based methods), and implies a more deterministic approach
to chemical/physical sub-grouping of amino acids . Amino acids (aa) are divided
into sub-groups with successive derivations, that result in a clustering based
on the considered property. The properties can be user defined or chosen
between default schemes, like those used in the analysis described here.
Starting from an initial set of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, they
are successively divided on the basis of their polarity/hydrophobic index, with
increasing resolution up to four level of subdivision. Other schemes of
subdivision are possible: in this thesis work it was employed also a scheme
based on physical/structural properties (solvent exposure, lateral chain
mobility and secondary structure tendency), that have been compared to the
chemical scheme with testing purposes. In the method described in this chapter,
the total score for each position in the alignment accounts for different
degree of similarity between amino acids. The scoring value result form the
contribution of each level of selectivity for every individual property
considered. Simply the method (called M_Al) analyse the n sequence alignment
position per position and assigns a score which have contributes by aa identity
plus a composed valuation of the chemical or of the structural affinity between
the n aligned amino acids. This method has been implemented in a series of
programs written in python language; these programs have been tested in some
biological cases, with benchmark purposes.
  Ni\'eb\'e is a food leguminous plant cultivated in tropical Africa for its
seeds rich in proteins. The main problem setted by its production is the
conservation of harvests. In the fields as in the stocks, the seeds are
destroyed by pests (bruchids). These bruchids are always associated with
several entomophagous species of hymenoptera. Four entomophagous species were
listed : an egg parasitoid (U lariophaga Stephan), and three solitary larval
and pupal ectoparasitoids (D. Basalis Rondoni, Pteromalidae; E. vuilleti
Crawford and E. orientalis Crawford, Eupelmidae). The survey of the populations
shows that at the beginning of storage, E orientalis is the most abundant
specie (72 %) whereas E. vuilleti and D. Basalis respectively represent 12 %
and 16 % of the hymenoptera. During storage, the E orientalis population
decreases gradually and it disappears completely in less than two months after
the beginning of storage. E. Vuilleti population becomes gradually more
important than D. basalis population which regress until less than 10 % of the
emerging parasitoids. E vuilleti adopts ovicide and larvicide behaviour against
D. Basalis. This behaviour explains its population regression inside granaries.
If the aggressive behaviour of this Eupelmidae is a constant, that could also
explain the disappearance of E orientalis. However if this species is
maintained in stocks, it would be an effective control agent of bruchids
according to their parasitic capacities. This study shows that ovicide and
larvicide behaviour of E vuilleti is not expressed against E orientalis. When
the females have exclusively the hosts already parasitized by E orientalis,
they do not lay eggs. The disappearance of E orientalis could not thus be
explained by the presence of E. vuilleti.
  Selective control in a population is the ability to control a member of the
population while leaving the other members relatively unaffected. The concept
of selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in
heterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in
heterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical
topology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the
statistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects
of superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel
pathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew
distributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show
that feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as
can discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective
control are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second
is a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the
signaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically
yields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations
susceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general
control strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the
least sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control
of robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive
nodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be
designed in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating
the selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.
  Bacterial chemotaxis in Escherichia coli is a canonical system for the study
of signal transduction. A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence
of precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in
single cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic
model, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed
in non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this
adaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation
and demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of
receptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics.
As a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a
sigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent
stochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in
response to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral
variability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in
response to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also
display the largest chemotactic response. Finally, Large-scale simulations of
digital bacteria suggest that the chemotaxis network is tuned to simultaneously
optimize the random spread of cells in absence of nutrients and the cellular
response to gradients of attractant.
  Biological networks have evolved to be highly functional within uncertain
environments while remaining extremely adaptable. One of the main contributors
to the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be
their modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are
strongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other
modules. Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and
robustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing
amount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous
features of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free
edge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks
evolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to
study modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic
points of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of
modularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the
yeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal pairs consist
mostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within
modules, while knockdown suppressor pairs are farther apart and often straddle
modules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways
or modules. The combination of network modularity tools together with genetic
interaction data constitutes a powerful approach to study and dissect the role
of modularity in the evolution and function of biological networks.
  This review presents the elastic theory of low-dimensional (one- and
two-dimensional) continua and its applications in bio- and nano-structures.
First, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the
low-dimensional continua, is briefly described through Cartan moving frame
method. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,
fluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
bio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,
are discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the
theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid
membranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a
composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little
similar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances
highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
nano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A
revised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density
approximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures
and strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical
mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based
on this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial
concepts, the Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled
carbon nanotubes, with this continuum form.
  Structural fluctuations in the thermal equilibrium of the kinesin motor
domain are studied using a lattice protein model with Go interactions. By means
of the multi-self-overlap ensemble (MSOE) Monte Carlo method and the principal
component analysis (PCA), the free-energy landscape is obtained. It is shown
that kinesins have two subdomains that exhibit partial folding/unfolding at
functionally important regions: one is located around the nucleotide binding
site and the other includes the main microtubule binding site. These subdomains
are consistent with structural variability that was reported recently based on
experimentally-obtained structures. On the other hand, such large structural
fluctuations have not been captured by B-factor or normal mode analyses. Thus,
they are beyond the elastic regime, and it is essential to take into account
chain connectivity for studying the function of kinesins.
  We derive rigorous results describing the asymptotic dynamics of a discrete
time model of spiking neurons introduced in \cite{BMS}. Using symbolic dynamic
techniques we show how the dynamics of membrane potential has a one to one
correspondence with sequences of spikes patterns (``raster plots''). Moreover,
though the dynamics is generically periodic, it has a weak form of initial
conditions sensitivity due to the presence of a sharp threshold in the model
definition. As a consequence, the model exhibits a dynamical regime
indistinguishable from chaos in numerical experiments.
  We present the spectrum of the (normalized) graph Laplacian as a systematic
tool for the investigation of networks, and we describe basic properties of
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Processes of graph formation like motif joining
or duplication leave characteristic traces in the spectrum. This can suggest
hypotheses about the evolution of a graph representing biological data. To this
data, we analyze several biological networks in terms of rough qualitative data
of their spectra.
  It is common to use reciprocal best hits, also known as a boomerang
criterion, for determining orthology between sequences. The best hits may be
found by blast, or by other more recently developed algorithms. Previous work
seems to have assumed that reciprocal best hits is a sufficient but not
necessary condition for orthology. In this article, I explain why reciprocal
best hits cannot logically be a sufficient condition for orthology. If
reciprocal best hits is neither sufficient nor necessary for orthology, it
would seem worthwhile to examine further the logical foundations of some
unsupervised algorithms that are used to identify orthologs.
  Transcription networks, and other directed networks can be characterized by
some topological observables such as for example subgraph occurrence (network
motifs). In order to perform such kind of analysis, it is necessary to be able
to generate suitable randomized network ensembles. Typically, one considers
null networks with the same degree sequences of the original ones. The commonly
used algorithms sometimes have long convergence times, and sampling problems.
We present here an alternative, based on a variant of the importance sampling
Montecarlo developed by Chen et al. [1].
  The binding neuron model is inspired by numerical simulation of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire
model. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed
period of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast
with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay
exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of
memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks
for computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact
mathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron
is driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest
networking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every
output spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this
construction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is
characterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution
if the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution
is calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for
binding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions
for leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is
oncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng
statistics. Information condensation at the level of single neuron is
discussed.
  The persistent pods of the tree, Acacia caven, that do not fall from the tree
provide opportunities for the appearance of a diverse group of insects the
following season. Such pods collected during the spring of 1999 in Chile were
indehiscent with highly sclerified pod walls. In contrast, persistent pods
collected in Uruguay after a wet winter and spring (2002) were partially
dehiscent, inducing the deterioration of the woody pods, and consequently
exposing the seeds. These persistent pods are a natural refuge for insect
species, namely two bruchid beetles (Pseudopachymeria spinipes, Stator
furcatus), one scolytidae (Dendroctonus sp), lepidopterous larvae, ant colonies
(Camponotus sp),one species of oophagous parasitoid (Uscana espinae group
senex), the gregarious larval-pupae parasitoid Monoksa dorsiplana
(Pteromalidae) and two species of Horismenus spp. (Eulophidae). The patriline
of M. dorsiplana is frequently formed by 1 son +7 daughters.
  A coarse-grained variational model is used to investigate the polymer
dynamics of barrier crossing for a diverse set of two-state folding proteins.
The model gives reliable folding rate predictions provided excluded volume
terms that induce minor structural cooperativity are included in the
interaction potential. In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper
interfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and
higher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly
correlated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing
the rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the
transition state ensemble non-uniformly across the set of protein studied.
Neverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform
across the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five. This
direct calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is
roughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier
heights obtained from the model and the best fit monomer relaxation time 30ns,
we find that 1/k0 (1-5)us (with average 1/k0 4us). This model can be extended
to study subtle aspects of folding such as the variation of the folding rate
with stability or solvent viscosity, and the onset of downhill folding.
  Pathways are integral to systems biology. Their classical representation has
proven useful but is inconsistent in the meaning assigned to each arrow (or
edge) and inadvertently implies the isolation of one pathway from another.
Conversely, modern high-throughput experiments give rise to standardized
networks facilitating topological calculations. Combining these perspectives,
we can embed classical pathways within large-scale networks and thus
demonstrate the crosstalk between them. As more diverse types of
high-throughput data become available, we can effectively merge both
perspectives, embedding pathways simultaneously in multiple networks. However,
the original problem still remains - the current edge representation is
inadequate to accurately convey all the information in pathways. Therefore, we
suggest that a standardized, well-defined, edge ontology is necessary and
propose a prototype here, as a starting point for reaching this goal.
  In this paper, we consider the statistical analysis of a protein interaction
network. We propose a Bayesian model that uses a hierarchy of probabilistic
assumptions about the way proteins interact with one another in order to: (i)
identify the number of non-observable functional modules; (ii) estimate the
degree of membership of proteins to modules; and (iii) estimate typical
interaction patterns among the functional modules themselves. Our model
describes large amount of (relational) data using a relatively small set of
parameters that we can reliably estimate with an efficient inference algorithm.
We apply our methodology to data on protein-to-protein interactions in
saccharomyces cerevisiae to reveal proteins' diverse functional roles. The case
study provides the basis for an overview of which scientific questions can be
addressed using our methods, and for a discussion of technical issues.
  This work is a study of the inter-relationship between parameters that
principally affect metal up-take in the plant. The relationships between the
concentration of metal in the growth medium, Cs, the concentration of metal
absorbed by the plant, Cp, and the total biomass achieved, M, all of which are
factors relevant to the efficiency of phytoremediation of the plant, have been
investigated via the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings
to Ni(II) stress. The factorial growth experiments treated the Ni(II)
concentration in the agar gel and the diurnal light quanta (DLQ) as
independently variable parameters. Observations included the evidence of light
enhancement of Ni toxicity at the root as well as at the whole plant level, the
shoot mass index as a possible indicator of shoot metal sequestration in B.
juncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of
M on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal
accumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall
metabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor
a high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from
the medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven
biomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to
remove the maximum mass of metal from the medium. The implications of these
observations in the context of the perceived need in phytoremediation
engineering to maximize Cp and M simultaneously in the same plant, are
discussed.
  We consider an asexual population evolving on rugged fitness landscapes which
are defined on the multi-dimensional genotypic space and have many local
optima. We track the most populated genotype as it changes when the population
jumps from a fitness peak to a better one during the process of adaptation.
This is done using the dynamics of the shell model which is a simplified
version of the quasispecies model for infinite populations and standard
Wright-Fisher dynamics for large finite populations. We show that the
population fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and
the shell model match for fit genotypes and at short times, but the dynamics of
the two models are identical for questions related to the most populated
genotype. We calculate exactly several properties of the jumps in infinite
populations some of which were obtained numerically in previous works. We also
present our preliminary simulation results for finite populations. In
particular, we measure the jump distribution in time and find that it decays as
$t^{-2}$ as in the quasispecies problem.
  A dynamical system model for tumor -- immune system interaction together with
a method to mimic radiation therapy are proposed. A large population of virtual
patients is simulated following an ideal radiation treatment. A characteristic
parameter, the Immune System -- Tumor Efficiency Rate (ISTER), is introduced.
ISTER dependence of treatment success and other features is studied.
Statistical results allow us to give a patient classification scheme.
Radiotherapy treatment biological effective dose (BED) is thus optimized based
on the patient physical condition, following the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably
Achievable) criterion.
  We present a model for diffusion in a molecularly crowded environment. The
model consists of random barriers in percolation network. Random walks in the
presence of slowly moving barriers show normal diffusion for long times, but
anomalous diffusion at intermediate times. The effective exponents for square
distance versus time usually are below one at these intermediate times, but can
be also larger than one for high barrier concentrations. Thus we observe sub-
as well as super-diffusion in a crowded environment.
  We study the problem of the emergence of cooperation in the spatial
Prisoner's Dilemma. The pioneering work by Nowak and May showed that large
initial populations of cooperators can survive and sustain cooperation in a
square lattice with imitate-the-best evolutionary dynamics. We revisit this
problem in a cost-benefit formulation suitable for a number of biological
applications. We show that if a fixed-amount reward is established for
cooperators to share, a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors
and form structures that are resilient to re-invasion even if the reward
mechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a
single cooperator and present agent-based simulations for small initial
fractions of cooperators. Large cooperation levels, in the sustainability
range, are found. In the conclusions we discuss possible applications of this
model as well as its connections with other mechanisms proposed to promote the
emergence of cooperation.
  We discuss various models of ion transport through cell membrane channels.
Recent experimental data shows that sizes of ion channels are compared to those
of ions and that only few ions may be simultaneously in any single channel.
Theoretical description of ion transport in such channels should therefore take
into account interactions between ions and between ions and channel proteins.
This is not satisfied by macroscopic continuum models based on
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. More realistic descriptions of ion transport
are offered by microscopic Brownian and molecular dynamics. One should also
take into account a dynamical character of the channel structure. This is not
yet addressed in the literature
  In this paper we present a novel framework for sequence to shape maps. These
combinatorial maps realize exponentially many shapes, and have preimages which
contain extended connected subgraphs of diameter n (neutral networks). We prove
that all basic properties of RNA folding maps also hold for combinatorial maps.
Our construction is as follows: suppose we are given a graph $H$ over the $\{1
>...,n\}$ and an alphabet of nucleotides together with a symmetric relation
$\mathcal{R}$, implied by base pairing rules. Then the shape of a sequence of
length n is the maximal H subgraph in which all pairs of nucleotides incident
to H-edges satisfy $\mathcal{R}$. Our main result is to prove the existence of
at least $\sqrt{2}^{n-1}$ shapes with extended neutral networks, i.e. shapes
that have a preimage with diameter $n$ and a connected component of size at
least $(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^n+(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^n$. Furthermore, we show
that there exists a certain subset of shapes which carries a natural graph
structure. In this graph any two shapes are connected by a path of shapes with
respective neutral networks of distance one. We finally discuss our results and
provide a comparison with RNA folding maps.
  We introduce a topology-based nonlinear network model of protein dynamics
with the aim of investigating the interplay of spatial disorder and
nonlinearity. We show that spontaneous localization of energy occurs
generically and is a site-dependent process. Localized modes of nonlinear
origin form spontaneously in the stiffest parts of the structure and display
site-dependent activation energies. Our results provide a straightforward way
for understanding the recently discovered link between protein local stiffness
and enzymatic activity. They strongly suggest that nonlinear phenomena may play
an important role in enzyme function, allowing for energy storage during the
catalytic process.
  We have investigated the migration behaviors of uranium (U) and thorium (Th)
in Earth and other terrestrial planets. Theoretical models of U and Th
migration have been proposed. These models suggest that the unique features of
Earth are closely connected with its unique U and Th migration models and
distribution patterns. In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative
volatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form
an enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the
crusts through magmatism and metamorphism. We emphasize that the formation of
an EZ of U, Th and other heat-producing elements is a prerequisite for the
formation of a plate tectonic system. The heat-producing elements, currently
mainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation
and evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental
crusts. In other terrestrial planets, including Mercury, Venus, and Mars, an EZ
can not be formed because of a lack of oxidative volatile components and water.
For this reason, a plate tectonic system can not been developed in these
planets. We also emphasize the influence of U and Th in EZ on the development
and evolution of life on Earth. We propose that since the Earth and planets
were born in a united solar system, there should be some common mechanisms to
create the similarities and differences between them. We have tried to develop
an integrated view to explain some problems in the tectonics of Earth and
evolution, bio-evolution, and planetary dynamics through U and Th geochemistry.
We believe that a comprehensive exploration on energy sources and their
evolution is a good way to build bridges between different disciplines of
science in order to better understand the Earth and planets.
  We incorporate hydrodynamic interactions in a structure-based model of
ubiquitin and demonstrate that the hydrodynamic coupling may reduce the peak
force when stretching the protein at constant speed, especially at larger
speeds. Hydrodynamic interactions are also shown to facilitate unfolding at
constant force and inhibit stretching by fluid flows.
  It is basic question in biology and other fields to identify the char-
acteristic properties that on one hand are shared by structures from a
particular realm, like gene regulation, protein-protein interaction or neu- ral
networks or foodwebs, and that on the other hand distinguish them from other
structures. We introduce and apply a general method, based on the spectrum of
the normalized graph Laplacian, that yields repre- sentations, the spectral
plots, that allow us to find and visualize such properties systematically. We
present such visualizations for a wide range of biological networks and compare
them with those for networks derived from theoretical schemes. The differences
that we find are quite striking and suggest that the search for universal
properties of biological networks should be complemented by an understanding of
more specific features of biological organization principles at different
scales.
  Anhedonia is one of the key symptoms of depression in humans. Consumption of
1% sucrose solution supplemented with 0.2% vanillin was studied in two
experimental contexts in male mice living under chronic social stress induced
by daily experience of defeats in agonistic interactions and leading to
development of depression. In the first experiment, vanillin sucrose solution
was made available as an option of water during 10 days to mice living in group
home cages. Then the mice were subjected to social defeat stress and during
stress exposure they were provided with both vanillin sucrose solution and
water using a free two bottles choice paradigm. In the other experiment,
vanillin sucrose solution were first offered to mice after 8 days of exposure
to social defeat stress. Males familiar with vanillin sucrose solution showed
vanillin sucrose preference while experiencing defeat stress: consumption of
vanillin sucrose solution was about 70% of total liquid consumption. However,
the consumption of vanillin sucrose solution per gram of body weight in mice
imposed to social stress during 20 days was significantly lower than in control
males. In the second experiment, males after 8 days of social defeat stress
were found to consume significantly less vanillin sucrose solution as compared
with control males. On average during two weeks of measurements, vanillin
sucrose solution intake was less than 20% of total liquid consumption in males
with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Consumption per gram of body weight
also appeared to be significantly lower than in control group. Influence of the
experimental context on the development of anhedonia, which was measured by the
reduction in sucrose solution intake by chronically stressed male mice, has
been discussed.
  Cortical neurons are subject to sustained and irregular synaptic activity
which causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential (Vm). We review
here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike
generation. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic
activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis
of intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and
inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic
variables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally
recorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from
the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic
conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of
experimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even
though the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the
precision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization
of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses
preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic
conductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are
evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro
with the dynamic-clamp technique. We review their applications to the analysis
of in vivo intracellular recordings in cat association cortex, which suggest a
predominant role for inhibition in determining both sub- and supra-threshold
dynamics of cortical neurons embedded in active networks.
